title: using GeekShed's BNC
---

i've been using GeekShed IRC for more than 90 days now, so I'm allowed the use of their BNC

# GeekShed BNC [manager](https://www.geekshed.net/bnc/?manage)
-- if "BNC Nickname" is the same as your original GeekShed nick, it will automagically identify with NickServ  

# hexchat  
-- 'Login Method' -> 'Server Password (/PASS password)' IS the same as typing '/quote PASS password'  
-- 'Password' above should be your original GeekShed username and password, seperated with a colon (username:password)  
-- use SSL  
-- use port 8888  
-- 'Server' is 'x.bnc.geekshed.net', mine was 'lucifer.bnc.geekshed.net'  

# notes
-- the BNC will never change your nick  
-- you can change your nick while being attached to the BNC, detach, reattach and you'll sill be using that first nick
